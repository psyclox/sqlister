## ⚡ Introduction  
 
The **TRASH** repository isn’t just a project.  
It’s an **obsession**, a **manifesto**, a **playground of chaos** for those who dare to see the world of exploits, breaches, and digital madness in its rawest form.  

> The internet calls us *hackers*, *cyberpunks*, *script kiddies*, or even *ghosts*.  
> But here, inside **TRASH**, labels mean nothing. Code, ideas, and exploits are all that matter.  

This repo symbolizes the **junkyard of the digital age** — the fragments of vulnerabilities, the leftovers of systems, and the hidden truths that corporations bury deep.  

We pick it up.  
We polish it.  
We weaponize it.

## 🕶️ Philosophy  

- **Obsession > Passion**  
  Not just interest in cyberworld — *we live inside it*.  

- **Exploitation > Exploration**  
  Every line of code is a key, every system is a locked door, and every locked door demands to be opened.  

- **Chaos > Order**  
  Systems thrive on order. We thrive on bending, twisting, and breaking it until *truth leaks out*.  

- **Trash > Treasure**  
  What society throws away, we collect.  
  That’s where true value hides.

## 📂 Contents  

This repository is divided into **three layers of obsession**:  

1. **💀 Core Exploits**  
   - A curated collection of scripts, snippets, and ideas pulled from the underbelly of the cyberworld.  
   - From buffer overflows to web exploits — everything messy, dirty, and raw.  

2. **🧠 Mental Trash**  
   - Notes, ramblings, and unfiltered thoughts about the state of cybersecurity.  
   - Not guides. Not tutorials. Just **raw obsession**.  

3. **🕳️ The Black Hole**  
   - Experimental code that might work or might burn down everything.  
   - Don’t expect stability. Expect **chaos**.

## 🧩 Why "TRASH"?  

Because everything in the cyberworld that seems like trash is actually **treasure for someone who knows how to use it**.  

- Old CVEs? We recycle them.  
- Dead code? We reanimate it.  
- Forgotten passwords? We resurrect them.  

This is not a clean repo. It’s not meant to be. It’s a **dumpyard of the dark digital age**.
